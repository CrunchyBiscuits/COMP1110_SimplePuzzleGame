comments:
  - I think those code in methods is well-documented. Those customised methods solve partial problems gradually and help us to understand easily how the problem be solved step by step.
  - In the following task 5, based on those customised methods, it solves the task efficiently and clearly.
  - I think the program decomposition is great, each method structure is appropriate.
  - I think those names of methods help us to understand the function of the specific method, however, some of those names are too long and complicated.
  - Therefore, those names need to set more properly. For example, followed by the naming rule, ifchallenge should change as ifChallenge.
  - I did not find any error, the code is very clear and the code writer just needs to notice tiny details.
