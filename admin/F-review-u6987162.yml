comments:
    This part of the code is very important for the Board part, and we need to implement game tiles.
    - Good features It is easy to understand and it shows that tha author has clear idea about what he wants to do and the code is readable.
    - Well documented I think those code is well-documented. From the document, I can know what the code wants to do.
    - Program decomposition I think the program decomposition is well. For example, the authour wrote the GameTail(char) and GameTail(char, Orientation) to generalize those two situation.
    - Code convention I think it follows java code conventions through the class with clear name and
    - Error It works well but when we put tiles like I140, the program does not set this situation as a fail.
    I think we can improve the code to reduce duplication. For example, about ine varience in the setHight and setWeight, we can control the coeffient sited in the left side of SQUARE_SIZE to reguralize the code.
