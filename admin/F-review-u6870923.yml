comments:
  - These two methods achieve the functions to show the challenge on gaming board and set up the sound of placing the tiles
  - Good features  Well designed, it is clear to understand how to transfer the challenge string to the images.
  - Well documented  Yes. She wrote the explaination and tell me the details about those two methods.
  - Decomposition appropriate  Yes. Those two methods are align with the structure in assignment1, well decomposition.
  - Code conventions  Yes. If make the challenge as a parameter, will it be better?
  - Error  No, the function works pretty well, but the implementations have some bugs, the sound loop won't stop if the tile is released,
    I suggested the implementation of the setUpSoundLoop() function should add in the event handler, but not the start() method.
